## Details of this project

### Motivation
The motive behind this project is to automate the heart rate reports that I've been collecting for the Tulsa Men's Soccer team.

### Description
This code is an implementation of report automation. The code receives a .csv file as input outputs a pdf that has charts relevant to the data. To use this code, you can just copy and paste it into your python interpreter.

In line 5, make sure to replace it with the csv file that you want to analyze.

### CSV File Format
The CSV file should atleast have the columns that are going to be displayed. You can change this according to your own project.
